* Practice Runs
- We will begin with a practice run so you can get a feel for the
  task. During this time, you will be playing against the experimenter
  and points will not be counted.
  
* Fixation crosses
- First you will see white fixation crosses against a black
  background. Please focus your attention on these white crosses.

* Pictures of Your Opponent
- You will then see a picture of your opponent. This could you be your
  human opponent, whom you will meet before the scan, or a picture
  indicating the trial will be against the computer opponent. (During
  the practice session, you will see a picture of a smiley face to
  indicate that the trial is against the experimenter).
- It is VERY IMPORTANT that you keep the joystick straight and in the
  center during the period the picture of your opponent is on the
  screen, or else the trial will not continue.

* Game
- During game play, you will control the movement of the ball with the
  joystick. Your purpose is to cross the goal with the ball and make
  it past the bar (controlled by the goalkeeper).
- Note: the edges of the bar are "sticky", and thus touching them will
  keep you from crossing the goal line.

* Payment
- You will receive $35 plus a $10 bonus for an accuracy rate above
  33%. That is, if you score on more than 33% of trials, you will
  receive the bonus.
- Good luck and have fun! Any questions?
